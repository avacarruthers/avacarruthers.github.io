## Hi there - it's nice to meet you - and welcome to my **personal portfolio** website!

I'm Ava, a second year Cyber Security Student, and I've created this repository to teach myself how to use GitHub while creating my own website portfolio.

This is a project that I will be routinely revisiting, around work and university requirments, and continually developing over time. For as long as this website portfolio is in use, it will be a living project of mine that will be added to as I gain certifications and take on new projects.

Thanks for checking this out!
